##Proliferation Analysis
The proliferation analysis methods is as follows:  
First, the cells within each well are gated into Edu+  
The proportion of EdU+ cells at each spot is calculated
The proportions are logit transformed then normalized
The normalized proportions are then summarized by the medians of their replicates.  
Plots show the distributions of the non-zero proportions and the proportions sumarized by ligand and ECM protein.

The table that follows shows the MEPs ranked by their EdU Proliferation Proportion.
