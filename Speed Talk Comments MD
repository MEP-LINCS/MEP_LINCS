eccentricity is based on an ellipse fitted to the nucleus. It is the ratio of the distance between the foci and the length of the major axis. 0 is a circle and approaching 1 approaches a line.

DNA2N All cells are binned into two classes based on their DNA content. The smaller bin is labeled DNA2N and the larger is DNA4N. These labels are a simplification and can really be though of as DNA3N and less vs DNA3N and more but that would just cause more confusion. 

For any population, DNA2N and DNA4N are between 0 and 1 while DNA2N+DNA4N=1. I believe these should be logic transformed

Would you care to add an example of an absolute intensity such as MitoTracker? This should inform how much mitochondrial activity is occurring. I believe it should be loved transformed. These values come to me linearly scaled between 0 and 1 with 1 being the maximum value of pixel intensity.

additional unwanted variations in immunofluorescence experiments include exposure times, filter positioning and segmentation algorithms.

I would (hopefully) add to your plan some involvement in experiment redesign.
